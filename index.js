/**
Challenge: 

- Make the styling more exciting once an activity idea comes 
back from the Bored API
    - Resources: DOM element "classList" property, uigradients.com, 
      Google Fonts, color.adobe.com
    - Some ideas:
      - Change the title from "BoredBot" to something more exciting!
      - Change the background to something less drab.
      - Bonus: Animate something on the screen to move around and add more 
        excitement to the page
